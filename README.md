A Minecraft Plugin that displays world day, with PlaceholderAPI support.

![DayCounterDescription](https://github.com/4rft5/DayCounter/assets/74219775/1a06f1bf-7ce8-48e8-8567-e3664b3de5d3)

  It runs on 1.20.4, it probably runs on other versions, but they haven't been tested.

  This plugin is designed to help replace the F3 daycounter, which seems to have been removed in 1.20.2.

  If /time set is used, it can mess up the vanilla day counter. This really only works if you do not use /time set.

  | /daycount help | lists the previous two commands |
