![DayCounterDescription](https://github.com/4rft5/DayCounter/assets/74219775/1a06f1bf-7ce8-48e8-8567-e3664b3de5d3)

  It runs on 1.20.4-1.21.11, it probably runs on other versions, but they haven't been tested.

  This plugin is designed to help replace the F3 daycounter, which seems to have been removed in 1.20.2.

  If /time set is used, it can mess up the vanilla day counter. This really only works if you do not use /time set.

  ### PlaceholderAPI

  The day count itself is stored in %daycounter_counter%, which can be used anywhere any other PlaceholderAPI placeholders can be used.

  Example use of the placeholder:
